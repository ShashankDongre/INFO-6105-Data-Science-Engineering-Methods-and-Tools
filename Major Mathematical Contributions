Major Mathematical Contributions of India
Calculus: Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in 14th century CE, developed infinite series expansions of trigonometric functions, an early form of calculus. He was first to discover power series expansion of sine, cosine, arctangent, and how these functions could be represented as infinite series of decreasing powers of x, where x is the angle in radians. He also discovered that the infinite series expansion of pi can be calculated using the following power series : π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ... This led to the development of numerical methods like Taylor Series, that is used for approximating the values of functions for solving mathematical problems. Even though Madhava lived nearly 300 years before European mathematicians such as Leibniz and Newton developed calculus, his mathematical discoveries and techniques were similar to those used in calculus, and his work in this area had a significant impact on the development of calculus as a branch of mathematics.
Combinatorics: Indian mathematician, Pingala in the fifth century BCE, wrote the "Chandas Shastra", which dealt with counting in poetry and prosody. This work provided the first known description of a binary number system, and the oldest known explanation of the Pascal's triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients. 
Gambling and Probability: Indian mathematician Bhāskara II in the 12th century CE, authored a treatise called the "Lilavati," which dealt with arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, as well as the mathematics of games of chance and probabilities. He applied his mathematical knowledge to tackle gambling-related challenges, such as calculating the probabilities of winning. He also investigated other forms of permutations and combinations, which he utilized to calculate the probability of various outcomes in games of chance.
The Concept of Zero: Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in the 7th century CE, wrote a treatise called "Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta" which gave zero a full mathematical representation. It included the concept of zero as a number and the rules for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with zero. He also used symbol for zero as '0' (Shunya). He also explained the rules for arithmetic operations involving positive and negative numbers, which included the use of negative numbers as the solutions to certain types of equations. He also developed the method of solving linear and quadratic equations by using the concept of zero and negative numbers. His work in this area is considered as a major milestone in the development of algebra and it was later followed by other Indian mathematicians such as Mahāvīra, Bhāskara II, and others.
Pi: Aryabhata, an Indian mathematician in 5th century CE, made an important addition to trigonometry by offering an exact approximation of the value of pi as a ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which he approximated as 3.1416. He was not the first to employ the value of pi, as it had already been used in ancient Egyptian and Greek mathematics. His figure of pi is considered one of the most accurate estimations of pi at the time, and it was utilized throughout India and Arabia for nearly a millennium before more exact approximations were developed. He also demonstrated how to compute the area of a triangle using a pi approximation.
Survey Methods: Indian mathematician and astronomer Brahmagupta in the 7th century CE, described survey methods in his book " Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta," where he discussed how to take measurements to calculate the area of a field and how to estimate the size of a population.
